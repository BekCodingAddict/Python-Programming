      "content='It seems there might be some misunderstanding in the inquiry. The snippet `\"<bound method Kernel.raw_input of <ipykernel.ipkernel.IPythonKernel object at 0x0000026E8BCE5570>>\"` is an object representation in Python related to an IPython or Jupyter Notebook environment. Here\\'s what this means:\\n\\n1. **IPython/Jupyter Kernel**: IPython provides a powerful interactive shell and Jupyter Notebooks use this, or a similar kernel system, to execute code in various languages. In your environment, the `IPythonKernel` object is running, managing the code execution.\\n\\n2. **`raw_input` Method**: The `raw_input` (now simply `input` in Python 3) function is a method to read a line from input, which is typically the console. However, in this context, it is bound within the kernel object, which possibly attempts to handle or manage input within this interactive session.\\n\\n3. **Callback/Lambda Function**: The `bound method` implies that this is a method ready to be invoked on the kernel object it\\'s associated with. It’s essentially a function that operates within this specific instance of the kernel.\\n\\nIn an interactive Python or Jupyter environment, calling `input()` would allow you to enter data directly through the console or the notebook interface, where the kernel takes this input and processes it. However, if this was encountered as a result of debugging or a specific function call, it may mean the environment tried to await user input or manage some interactive feature internally.\\n\\nIf you were encountering an error or trying to use this object in a script, you may want to reassess the read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) or interactive component of your implementation. Understanding how your script interacts within this environment, particularly how input is processed or expected, might resolve your problem. Alternatively, if you are trying to develop or fix something involving user input in a Jupyter notebook, check how the input is being handled, and that input/output cell behaviour is as expected.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 413, 'prompt_tokens': 57, 'total_tokens': 470, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_b1442291a8', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CdKjVXkdwtbKVU2Y0mNcbAShxAq0I', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--74f2e547-8da3-4e42-8f17-5ea4d7f9b06e-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 57, 'output_tokens': 413, 'total_tokens': 470, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"

Check your code for places where interaction with system input/output might be taking place and make sure you’re handling these correctly.\n",
