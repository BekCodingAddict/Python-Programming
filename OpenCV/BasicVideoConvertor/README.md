<h2>Short Explantation of My basic VideoConvertor Code</h2>
  
This code will create a GUI window with three buttons: one for selecting the input video file, 
one for selecting the output file path, and one for starting the conversion process.
The input video file should be in .mp4, .avi, or .mkv format. The output file will be in .mp4 format.
When the conversion process starts, the input video file is read and the output video file is created with
the same video codec, frame rate, width, and height as the input video. The frames are then read from the input
file and written to the output file until the end of the file is reached.
Finally, a message box is displayed
to indicate that the conversion process has completed.
